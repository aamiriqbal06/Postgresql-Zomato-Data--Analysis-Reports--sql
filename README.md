## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

  - **`data/`**: Contains all the raw `.csv` files used for populating the database (`customers.csv`, `orders.csv`, `restaurants.csv`, `riders.csv`, `deliveries.csv`).
  - **`erd.png`**: The Entity-Relationship Diagram illustrating the database schema.
  - **`database_setup.sql`**: SQL script for creating the database schema, including all tables and relationships.
  - **`20_business_problems_solution.sql`**: A single SQL file containing the queries and solutions for all 20 business problems.

## Tools and Technologies

  * **Database:** PostgreSQL
  * **Language:** SQL
  * **Key SQL Concepts Applied:**
      * Joins (INNER, LEFT)
      * Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
      * Window Functions (`RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `LAG()`)
      * Aggregate Functions (`COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`)
      * Date/Time Functions (`EXTRACT`, `TO_CHAR`)
      * Subqueries
      * Conditional Logic (`CASE` statements)

## Data Model and ERD

The database follows a schema designed to capture the core entities of a food delivery platform: customers, restaurants, orders, riders, and deliveries. The relationships between these entities are visualized in the ERD below.
![ERD](erd.png)

## Database Setup and Initialization

The database `zomato_db` is created and populated using the provided SQL scripts.

### 1\. Dropping Existing Tables

To ensure a clean setup, we first drop any existing tables.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS deliveries;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Orders;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS restaurants;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS riders;
```

### 2\. Creating Tables

The tables are created with appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to maintain data integrity.

```sql
-- 2. Creating Tables
CREATE TABLE restaurants (
    restaurant_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    restaurant_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(50),
    opening_hours VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    reg_date DATE
);

CREATE TABLE riders (
    rider_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    rider_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    sign_up DATE
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    restaurant_id INT,
    order_item VARCHAR(255),
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    order_time TIME NOT NULL,
    order_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (restaurant_id) REFERENCES restaurants(restaurant_id)
);

CREATE TABLE deliveries (
    delivery_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    delivery_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    delivery_time TIME,
    rider_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (rider_id) REFERENCES riders(rider_id)
);
```

## Data Cleaning

Data integrity is paramount for accurate analysis. A key step in this project was handling missing values. For example, `total_amount` in the `orders` table could have nulls, which would skew financial calculations. This was addressed by updating `NULL` values to `0`.

```sql
-- Example: Handling NULLs in total_amount
UPDATE orders
SET total_amount = COALESCE(total_amount, 0);
```

## Business Problems and SQL Solutions

Here are the 20 business problems solved using SQL, along with the business insight behind each question.

        o.order_item AS dishes,
        COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
    FROM
        orders AS o
    JOIN
        customers AS c ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    WHERE
        c.customer_name = 'Arjun Mehta'
        AND o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 Year'
    GROUP BY
        c.customer_name, o.order_item
)
-- 2. Select from the CTE
SELECT
    customer_name,
    dishes,
    total_orders
FROM
    RankedOrders
WHERE
    rank <= 5
ORDER BY
    total_orders DESC; -- Add a final ORDER BY for a clean, sorted result
```

```sql
SELECT
	c.customer_name,
	SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent
FROM orders as o
	JOIN customers as c
	ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(o.total_amount) > 100000;
```

### 5\. Orders Without Delivery

  * **Business Question:** Which orders were placed but never delivered, and at which restaurants?
  * **Insight:** This query identifies operational failures. A high number of undelivered orders for a restaurant could indicate issues with order acceptance, rider assignment, or system errors, which need immediate attention.

<!-- end list -->

```sql
SELECT
	r.restaurant_name,
	r.city,
	COUNT(o.order_id) as cnt_not_delivered_orders
FROM orders as o
LEFT JOIN
restaurants as r
ON r.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id
LEFT JOIN
deliveries as d
ON d.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE d.delivery_id IS NULL
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```

### 6\. Restaurant Revenue Ranking by City

  * **Business Question:** How do restaurants rank by total revenue within their respective cities over the last year?
  * **Insight:** This helps identify top-performing restaurants in each market, which can be promoted as "top-rated" or "most popular." It also helps the sales team identify potential partners.

<!-- end list -->

```sql
WITH ranking_table AS (
	SELECT
		r.city,
		r.restaurant_name,
		SUM(o.total_amount) as revenue,
		RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY r.city ORDER BY SUM(o.total_amount) DESC) as rank
	FROM orders as o
	JOIN
	restaurants as r
	ON r.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id
	WHERE o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year'
	GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT

SELECT *
FROM
(
    SELECT
        r.city,
        o.order_item as dish,
        COUNT(order_id) as total_orders,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY r.city ORDER BY COUNT(order_id) DESC) as rank
    FROM orders as o
    JOIN
    restaurants as r
    ON r.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id
    GROUP BY 1, 2
) as t1
WHERE rank = 1;
```

### 8\. Customer Churn Analysis

  * **Business Question:** Which customers placed orders in 2023 but have not placed any in 2024?
  * **Insight:** This query identifies churned customers. The marketing team can target this segment with "We miss you" campaigns or special discounts to win them back.

<!-- end list -->

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM orders
WHERE
	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = 2023
	AND
	customer_id NOT IN
					(SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM orders
					WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = 2024);
```

### 9\. Year-over-Year Cancellation Rate

  * **Business Question:** How does the order cancellation rate for each restaurant in the current year compare to the previous year?
  * **Insight:** A rising cancellation rate is a red flag, indicating potential issues with a restaurant's service (e.g., long wait times, low stock). This metric helps in performance reviews with restaurant partners.

<!-- end list -->

```sql
WITH cancel_ratio_23 AS (
    SELECT
        o.restaurant_id,
        (COUNT(CASE WHEN d.delivery_id IS NULL THEN 1 END)::numeric / COUNT(o.order_id)::numeric) * 100 AS cancel_ratio
    FROM orders AS o
    LEFT JOIN deliveries AS d ON o.order_id = d.order_id
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date) = 2023
    GROUP BY o.restaurant_id
),
cancel_ratio_24 AS (
    SELECT
        o.restaurant_id,
        (COUNT(CASE WHEN d.delivery_id IS NULL THEN 1 END)::numeric / COUNT(o.order_id)::numeric) * 100 AS cancel_ratio
    FROM orders AS o
    LEFT JOIN deliveries AS d ON o.order_id = d.order_id
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date) = 2024
    GROUP BY o.restaurant_id
)
SELECT
    r.restaurant_name,
    COALESCE(curr.cancel_ratio, 0) AS current_year_cancel_ratio,
    COALESCE(prev.cancel_ratio, 0) AS last_year_cancel_ratio
FROM restaurants r
LEFT JOIN cancel_ratio_24 curr ON r.restaurant_id = curr.restaurant_id
LEFT JOIN cancel_ratio_23 prev ON r.restaurant_id = prev.restaurant_id;
```

### 10\. Rider Average Delivery Time

  * **Insight:** This is a key performance indicator (KPI) for riders. It helps in identifying both efficient and underperforming riders, allowing for training or incentive programs.

<!-- end list -->

```sql
SELECT
    d.rider_id,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (d.delivery_time - o.order_time +
	CASE WHEN d.delivery_time < o.order_time THEN INTERVAL '1 day' ELSE
	INTERVAL '0 day' END)))/60 as avg_delivery_time_minutes
FROM orders AS o
JOIN deliveries AS d
ON o.order_id = d.order_id
WHERE d.delivery_status = 'Delivered'
GROUP BY d.rider_id
ORDER BY 2;
```

### 11\. Monthly Restaurant Growth

  * **Business Question:** What is the month-over-month growth rate in delivered orders for each restaurant?
  * **Insight:** Tracks the performance and trajectory of restaurant partners. A high-growth restaurant could be a candidate for a strategic partnership, while a declining one may need support.

```sql
WITH monthly_orders AS (
    SELECT
        o.restaurant_id,
        TO_CHAR(o.order_date, 'YYYY-MM') as order_month,
        COUNT(o.order_id) as current_month_orders
    FROM orders as o
    JOIN deliveries as d ON o.order_id = d.order_id
    WHERE d.delivery_status = 'Delivered'
    GROUP BY 1, 2
),
growth_data AS (
    SELECT
        restaurant_id,
        order_month,
        current_month_orders,
        LAG(current_month_orders, 1, 0) OVER(PARTITION BY restaurant_id ORDER BY order_month) as prev_month_orders
    FROM monthly_orders
)
SELECT
	restaurant_id,
	order_month,
	prev_month_orders,
	current_month_orders,
	CASE
	    WHEN prev_month_orders > 0 THEN ROUND((current_month_orders::numeric - prev_month_orders::numeric) / prev_month_orders::numeric * 100, 2)
	    ELSE NULL
	END as growth_ratio_percent
FROM growth_data;
```

### 12\. Customer Segmentation (Gold/Silver)

  * **Insight:** This provides a simple but effective way to segment the user base. The 'Gold' segment contributes more revenue and should be nurtured to maintain their loyalty.

<!-- end list -->

```sql
WITH customer_spending AS (
    SELECT
		customer_id,
		SUM(total_amount) as total_spent,
		COUNT(order_id) as total_orders
	FROM orders
	GROUP BY 1
),
avg_order_value AS (
    SELECT AVG(total_amount) as aov FROM orders
)
SELECT
	CASE
		WHEN cs.total_spent > av.aov THEN 'Gold'
		ELSE 'Silver'
	END as customer_segment,
	COUNT(cs.customer_id) as number_of_customers,
